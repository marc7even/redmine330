0.0.2 (2013-02-22):
    * Workaround requirement for a call to Setting.plugin_redmine_custom_help_url['custom_help_url'], via
      RedmineCustomHelpUrl::Redmine::Info, by moving the addition of new help top_menu item to after
      Redmine::Plugin.register
    * Refactor: use overridden module RedmineCustomHelpUrl::Redmine::Info instead of directly calling
      Setting.plugin_redmine_custom_help_url['custom_help_url']
    * Add fall-back mechanism to Redmine default (http://www.redmine.org/guide) when
      RedmineCustomHelpUrl::Redmine::Info.help_url is not configured (blank)
    * Generic Rails 3 / Redmine 2.x support
    * Added documentation

0.0.1 (2013-02-21):
    - Un-released skeleton version of the plugin with only basic functionality (Redmine 1.x only)
